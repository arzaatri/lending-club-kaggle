Brief notebook building an XGBoost model to assess default risk on loans. Uses the 2007-2011 leanding club loans dataaset found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/rachitsuccess/lending-club)

The notebook includes some EDA, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and tuning/evaluation of an XGBoost classifier to predict individuals' risk of default on a loan.  At the end are future directions where I would have liked to take the model; however, the notebook was kept fairly simple as this was done as part of an interview process where only certain things were meant to be demonstrated.
